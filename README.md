# Melodies_For_Memories

This is a website to support the facebook page I co-founded, which is aimed at raising money for basic Alzheimer's research. The movement has involved hundreds of people, raised thousands of dollars, and has a global reach of over twenty thousand people. Interestingly, it really took off in the Philippines. 

On this webpage, I used two API's to display top stories about Alzheimer's in the news and recent breakthroughs in Alzheimer's research. The API's used are the New York Times and PubMed respecitvely to accomplish these goals. I explored the use of linear opacity gradients in the title, and parallax for the multiple backgrounds which gently suggest a lighter feel as one scrolls through the page (from problem to resolution). Additionally, I implemented the facebook's embedded video feature.
